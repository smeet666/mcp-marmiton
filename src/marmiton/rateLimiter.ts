 * Serial request queue with an adaptive minimum interval.

 * Marmiton publishes no rate limit and answers a burst by refusing rather than

 * starts. When the site does push back, the interval doubles and then decays
 * back down as requests succeed, which recovers faster than a fixed delay and
 * behaves better than a constant rate.
