# Changelog

## 1.1.0

- Cache a response only once it has been read successfully. The cache stored
  the raw response before parsing, so a page Marmiton served but this client could
  not understand stayed pinned for the cache lifetime and was replayed on every
  retry: the tool could not recover even after the site was healthy again. It
  now holds the parsed result, which also keeps the raw payload out of memory.

## 1.0.4

- Claim a pacing slot per request instead of per task. A task runs a whole
  retry chain, so stamping only its start let the next task follow the chain's
  last request with no gap, below the interval the configuration promises.
- Honour `Retry-After` when Marmiton sends one, in both its seconds and its
  HTTP-date form, instead of guessing a delay. The wait is spent between
  attempts rather than after the last one, where nobody would use it.
- Treat HTTP 403 as a refusal to back off from. It was reported as a plain
  error, so the client kept its pace in the one situation where slowing down is
  the remedy.
- Bound the pacing wait by the interval. A clock stepped backwards, by NTP or a
  resumed virtual machine, made the next request wait for the size of the step,
  and the queue is serial so every pending call waited behind it.
- Enforce the pacing floor and the identifying User-Agent in the client rather
  than only when reading the environment. The client is published through the
  `./client` export and accepts a caller-built config, so both promises were
  previously optional for anyone importing the library.

## 1.0.3

- Refresh the packaged README, which now carries one-click install links for
  Cursor and VS Code and a link to the entry in the official MCP registry.
- Keep LICENSE to the plain MIT text. License detectors match the file against
  the canonical template, so the trailing scope note made the package read as
  unlicensed; that note lives in the README. It also described lyrics rather
  than recipes.

## 1.0.2

- Keep a scaled mass or volume at a human size. Multiplying a recipe for a
  canteen returned "8335 g de sucre", which is correct and unusable; it now reads
  "8,34 kg". Amounts climb to the unit above at a full unit of it, and come back
  down below one, so half a litre reads "50 cl" rather than "1/2 l".
- Write mass and volume as decimals rather than fractions. Fractions belong to
  things a cook counts or spoons out: "8 1/3 kg" is not how anyone weighs sugar.

  Note that `amount` is expressed in `unit`, which may now differ from the unit
  the recipe used. Read the two together: 200 g scaled tenfold reports an amount
  of 2 with a unit of kg, so the bare number shrinks while the quantity grows.

## 1.0.1

- Make a counted ingredient agree with its amount when scaling **up**, not only
  when scaling down. Tripling a recipe returned "3 brioche" and "3 orange"
  alongside a correct "30 oeufs", because the agreement helper only knew how to
  remove a plural mark. Nouns that take no plural mark, and those whose singular
  already ends in -s, are still left untouched.

## 1.0.0

First stable release. The tool contracts are settled: tool names, their parameters
and the shape of their structured output will only change in a future major
version.

Every tool has been exercised end to end against the live site, including the
paths that are easy to get wrong: scaling down without ever asking for more than
the original, scaling without ever rounding an ingredient away to nothing,
recipes that state no yield, and a page that loads without structured recipe data.

## 0.1.0

Initial release. Three read-only tools over stdio, no API key: `search_recipes`,
`get_recipe` (with optional rescaling) and `scale_ingredients` (offline).
